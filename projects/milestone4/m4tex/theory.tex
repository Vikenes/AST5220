\subsubsection{Angular power spectrum} \label{sssec:M4:theory:angular_power_spectrum}
The temperature fluctuations can be expanded in spherical harmonics as \pnote{check summation indices and momentum vector.} 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M4:theory:theta_expansion_in_spherical_harmonics}
    \Theta(\vec{x}, \hat{\vec{p}}, t) = \sum_{\ell=1}^{\infty} \sum_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} a_\lm(\vec{x}, t) Y_\lm(\hat{\vec{p}}), 
\end{equation}
where the amplitudes, $a_\lm$, contain all the information about the temperature field, and are to be evaluated at our position in the Universe at $t=t_0$. However, we are unable to make prediction about particular values of these amplitudes, as inflation is a stochastic process. However, we exploit the fact that inflation predicts $\Theta$ to be very close to Gaussian, so each $a_\lm$ is therefore drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean and a variance given as 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M4:theory:variance_of_alms}
    \expval{a_\lm a_\lmp} = \delta_{\ell \ell'} \delta_{m m'} \cl.
\end{equation} 
\note{Write something about statistics?}

We follow the approach of \cite[Ch. 9.5]{Dodelson}, leaving out the details of the derivation. We now omit factors of $t$ in the expressions, as we are only concerned with the value at $t=t_0$, and obtain   
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M4:theory:C_ell_integral_definition}
    \cl = 4\pi \int \P_\R (k) \abs{\Theta_\ell\code(k)}^2 \,\frac{\dd k}{k},
\end{equation}
where we have used $\Theta_\ell(\vec{k})= \Theta_\ell\code(k) \R\ini$, where $\R\ini\propto\Psi$ comes from inflation. This rescaling accounts for the fact that we have set $\Psi=-2/3$ as our initial condition when solving the perturbation ODEs numerically. $\P_\R(k)$ is related to the primordial power spectrum, $P(k)$, via 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M4:theory:primordial_power_spectrum_}
    P(k) = \frac{2\pi^2}{k^3}\P_\R(k),
\end{equation}
where $\expval{\R\ini(\vec{k}) \R\ini^*(\vec{k}')}=(2\pi^2)\delta(\vec{k}-\vec{k}') P(k)$. To compute $\cl$, the last thing we need is an expression for $\P_\R(k)$. We get an expression for this from the fact that most inflationary models predict a so-called Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum \pnote{cite}, where 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M4:theory:primordial_power_spectrum}
    \P_\R(k) = \as \pclosed{\frac{k}{\kp}}^{\ns-1}, 
\end{equation}
where $\as$ is the amplitude of \note{something}, $\kp$ is the \note{something} and $\ns$ is the spectral index. \note{Comment about their meaning.} 

Thus, the final expression we want to compute is 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M4:theory:CMB_power_spectrum}
    \cl = 4\pi \int_0^\infty \as \pclosed{\frac{k}{\kp}}^{\ns-1} \Theta_\ell^2(k) \, \frac{\dd k}{k}.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Matter power spectrum} \label{sssec:M4:theory:matter_power_spectrum}
From the Fourier components of the matter overdensity field, we can compute the matter power-spectrum
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M4:theory:MatterPS_of_x_k}
    P_L(k,x) = \abs{\Delta_M(k,x)}^2,\quad \text{where}\quad \Delta_M(k,x) \equiv \frac{k^2 \Phi(k,x)}{\frac{3}{2}\omn a^{-1} H_0^2}.
\end{equation}
Once again, we have to take rescale $\Delta_M$ to account for our choice of initial conditions. Taking the value today, we thus want to compute 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M4:theory:MatterPS_code_today}
    \plk = \abs{\Delta_M\code(k)}^2 P(k) = \abs{\Delta_M\code(k)}^2\, \frac{2\pi^2}{k^3}\pclosed{\frac{k}{\kp}}^{\ns-1}.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Line-of-sight integration}\label{sssec:M4:theory:line_of_sight_integration}
As mentioned in \secref{sssec:M3:theory:perturbation_equations}, we compute higher order multipoles from the LOS approach. 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M4:theory:Theta_ell_LOS_integration}
    \Theta_\ell(k,x=0) = \int_{-\infty}^0 \tilde{S}(k,x) j_\ell [k(\eta_0 - \eta(x))]\,\dd x, 
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{S}(k,x)$ is the source function, which is given by 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M4:theory:source_function_LOS}
    \begin{split}
        \tilde{S}(k,x) =& \g \bclosed{\Theta_0 + \Psi + \frac{1}{4} \Pi} + e^{-\tau}\bclosed{\Psi' - \Phi'} \\
        & - \frac{1}{k}\dv{x}(\H \g \vb) + \frac{3}{4k^2}\dv{x}\bclosed{\H \dv{x}(\H\g\Pi)},
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\Pi=\Theta_2$. From the source function alone we may get some insight into how different physical effects will affect the power spectrum. In \secref{sssec:M4:results:angular_power_spectrum} we will present a more detailed discussion of the various terms, by comparing the resulting $\cl$ obtained from individual components in $S(k,x)$ alone. Here, we begin by presenting an overall idea behind each term. \note{DÃ¥rlig avsnitt.} 

The main physical idea behind the LOS approach, is that light observed in a given direction from the CMB today, is directly related to the CMB monopole along the LOS from us to infinity. The four terms in the source function represent different physical effects, with the first two being the so-called Sachs-Wolfe (SW) term and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. Since $\g$ is a sharply peaked at recombination, approximating it as a delta function yields $\Thl\tday(k)\approx \bclosed{\Thn + \Psi + \Pi/4}\rec\cdot j_\ell(k\eta_0)$, where we have used $\eta\rec\ll\eta_0$. The term $\Thn+\Psi$ represents an effective photon temperature. As the decoupled photons travel freely towards us today, they are gravitationally redshifted by the potential, $\Psi$. Hence, the SW term is an effective photon temperature with a tiny quadrupole correction.

The ISW represents the fact that gravitational potentials may change in time as photons move through it. For freely moving photons entering gravitational potentials, there is no net change in temperature if the potentials remain constant in time. Photons entering a gravitational potential gets an energy change that is cancelled out by the energy change it experiences when it leaves the gravitational potential again, if the potential remains constant in time. \note{Mention how this affects power spectrum at small and large scales.} The potentials are also weighted by a factor $e^{-\tau}$, so we only get a contribution from this term after recombination. Since the potentials are approximately constant during matter domination, we expect a contribution from ISW around recombination from intermediate scale modes, where the potential varies during recombination, as seen from \figref{fig:M3:results:Phi}. After this, we expect to get a contribution at late times, when the Universe starts accelerating. From \figref{fig:M3:results:Phi}, we see that the large scale modes varies most, and with $\tau(0)=0$, we therefore expect the largest contribution to $\cl$ to be at large scales, i.e. low $\ell$.  

The third term in \Eqref{eq:M4:theory:source_function_LOS} is effectively a dipole term, since $\vb\sim\vg$ at early times. From our discussion of the evolution of the monopole and dipole, in \figref{fig:M3:results:deltas} and \ref{fig:M3:results:vels}, we can expect the dipole term to contribute on scales that had entered the horizon before decoupling, as the larger modes don't oscillate until they enter the horizon, which occurs when $\g\approx0$. The final term is a quadrupole term, and is related to the angular dependence of Thompson scattering. However, as we will see in \secref{ssec:M4:results}, this term gives a very small contribution.

If we ignore the ISW contribution, at very small scales we have $\Thl\approx (\Thn + \Psi)\ini j_\ell(k\eta_0)$. Substituting $x=k\eta_0$, the integral in \Eqref{eq:M4:theory:CMB_power_spectrum} for $\ns=1$ becomes 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M4:theory:C_ell_SW_plateau_integral}
    \begin{split}
        \cl &= 4\pi \as \abs{(\Thn+\Psi)\ini}^2 \frac{1}{(\kp \eta_0)^{\ns-1}} \int_0^\infty \dd\, x j_\ell^2(x) x^{\ns-2}, \\
        \implies& \frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{2\pi}\cl = \as \abs{(\Thn+\Psi)\ini}^2 = \text{constant}.   
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
When plotting the CMB power spectrum, we will plot the RHS of \Eqref{eq:M4:theory:C_ell_SW_plateau_integral} against $\ell$ in units of $\mathrm{\mu K^2}$. We have $\ns=0.965<1$, so we have $\ell(\ell+1)\cl\propto \ell^{\ns-1}$, which will induces a small tilt at low $\ell$. The ISW will also result in a further deviation from a constant value.
