\subsection{Implementation details}\label{ssec:M4:implementations} 
One of the most crucial parts about integrating to obtain $\Theta_l(k)$ and $\cl$, is that the quantities we're integrating are oscillating rapidly. We must therefore ensure that we have a sufficiently high resolution, so that we accurately sample the integrands.
