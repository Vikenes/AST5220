\section{Milestone IV}\label{sec:M4}
We now have all the necessary constituents needed to compute the main quantity of interest in the report, the CMB power spectrum. By expanding the temperature field in spherical harmonics, we will be able to exploit the line-of-sight (LOS) integration technique in order to efficiently compute multipoles up to $\ell=2000$. From the multipoles, we will compute the CMB power spectrum, and compare this to observations from Planck experiments. By studying the power spectrum in some detail, we will also gain crucial physical insight into the various processes that determines the growth of structure in the early Universe. 

We are concerned with both the angular power spectrum of the CMB, and the matter power spectrum. When only "power spectrum" is written, we are referring to the former, and other power spectra will be referred to with appropriate prefixes. Most of our discussion of the physics behind various aspects of the power spectrum will be qualitative, where most is obtained from \cite[Ch. 9]{Dodelson}.
