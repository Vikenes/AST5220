\section{Milestone IV}\label{sec:M4}
We now have all the necessary constituents needed to compute the main quantity of interest in the report, the CMB power spectrum. By expanding the temperature field in spherical harmonics, we will be able to predict the angular CMB power spectrum to the observed values, and from that extract information about the underlying physics of the early Universe.
