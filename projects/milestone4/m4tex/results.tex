\subsection{Results}\label{ssec:M4:results}


\subsubsection{CMB power spectrum} \label{sssec:M4:results:angular_power_spectrum}
The angular power spectrum is shown in \figref{fig:M4:results:peaks_and_troughs_cells}. We also include data from \cite{Planck2020} for low $\ell$ values. At higher $\ell$, neutrinos, helium and reionization becomes important, and the predicted value of $\cl$ would deviate from that of observations \pnote{Write about how/why these things affect it.} To understand the physics behind the CMB power spectrum, we have also drawn vertical lines showing the peaks (red) and the troughs (blue) in the spectrum. 

The peaks we observe in the power spectrum are a result of the oscillations of the photon baryon plasma. When photons decouple from baryons, modes at different scales will be in different states. If the plasma is fully compressed upon recombination, the photons have to escape from deep potential wells, and will therefore be redshifted. Similarly, if a mode is fully decompressed when recombination happens, the photons can escape without much energy loss. Since $\cl$ depends on the absolute value of the photons multipoles, both of these cases will result in a peak of the power spectrum. The troughs therefore correspond to modes for which the temperature perturbation is approximately zero.  

As seen in \secref{ssec:M3:results}, the size of the modes strongly affect their behaviour before decoupling. Small scale modes will undergo several oscillations before recombination occurs. The number of oscillations a mode undergoes before decoupling decreases for larger scale modes, and for modes larger than the horizon during recombination, we expect no oscillations to take place. Thus, the peak at $\ell=205$ corresponds to a mode that just began to oscillate, with recombination taking place when it was at its maximum. As $\ell$ is decreased from $205$, the modes are gradually less compressed, until we reach scales of modes that had not entered the horizon before decoupling.

To see that the peaks and troughs in \figref{fig:M4:results:peaks_and_troughs_cells} actually correspond to modes where $\Thn$ is at extrema, we plot $\Thn(k,x)$ as a function of $x$ for $k=\lp/\etan$ and $k=\lt/\etan$, shown in \figref{fig:M4:results:theta0_at_peaks_and_troughs}. We also mark the region of $x\sim x\rec$. \note{Comment on why recombination isn't instantaneous.} As evident from the figure, the first three peaks of $\cl$ correspond to modes on scales that are at maxima. The troughs occur at scales that are essentially zero deviation from the initial temperature perturbation. Modes with wavenumber $k\sim\lt/\etan$ give roughly zero contribution to the power spectrum, but there are many modes of different wavenumbers with a non-zero contribution, resulting in the troughs we see in the power spectrum, and not $C_{\lt}=0$. Another important feature, is that the maxima of $\Thn(x)$ in the upper panel of \figref{fig:M4:results:theta0_at_peaks_and_troughs} don't occur at $x=x\rec$. In general, inhomogeneities on scale $k$ contributes to $\cl$ at slightly lower value of $\ell$ than $\ell=k\eta_0$. One reason for this, is that $\jell(x)$ peaks when $\ell$ is slightly smaller than $x$.

The next prominent feature in \figref{fig:M4:results:peaks_and_troughs_cells} are the damping of the peaks at small scales. During tight coupling, photons and baryons do not behave exactly as one fluid. In reality, photons travel a certain distance between scattering events, essentially performing random walks. During a Hubble time $H^{-1}$, a photon will scatter $N=n_e \sigma_T / H$ times, and with a mean free path of $\mfp$, the mean distance a photon travels during a Hubble time is 
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_D = \mfp \sqrt{N} = \sqrt{n_e \sigma_T H}^{-1}.
\end{equation}

As previously discussed, recombination is not an instantaneous event,
