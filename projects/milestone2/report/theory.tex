\subsubsection{Optical depth and visibility function} \label{sssec:M2:optical_depth_and_visibility_function}
\note{Write about the basics of optical depth.}

The optical depth is defined in terms of the scale factor, $a$, as 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M2:theory:optical_depth_integral_definition}
    \tau(\eta) = \int_\eta^{\eta_0} \dd \eta' \,n_e \sigma_T a,
\end{equation}
where $n_e(\eta)$ is the electron number density,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M2:theory:thomspon_cross_section}
    \sigma_T=\frac{8\pi\alpha^2}{3 m_e^2} = 6.6524587158\cdot 10^{-29}\unit{m^2} 
\end{equation}
is the Thompson cross-section and $a$ is the scale factor. $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant and $m_e$ is the electron mass. Using Eq. \eqref{eq:M1:theory:eta_ODE}, we can rewrite Eq. \eqref{eq:M2:theory:optical_depth_integral_definition} as a differential equation 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M2:theory:tau_ODE}
    \dv{\tau}{x} = - \frac{n_e \sigma_T}{H},
\end{equation}
which we will solve numerically. The initial condition is $\tau(x=0)=0$.

From the optical depth, we obtain the so-called \textit{visibility function}, which is defined as 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M2:theory:g_tilde_of_x_definition}
    \gx = -\tau' e^{-\tau},
\end{equation}
which is normalized as 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M2:theory:g_tilde_normalization}
    \int_{-\infty}^0\dd x\,\gx = 1.
\end{equation}
The normalization means that $\gx$ is a probability distribution, and we may interpret it as the probability of an observed CMB photon today having experienced its last scattering at a time $x$. \note{Why do we need derivatives?} Once we have an expression for $n_e(x)$, we have all the constituents needed 
to compute $\tau$ and $\g$.

\subsubsection{Electron density \note{(working title)}} \label{sssec:M2_electron_density}
Instead of computing $n_e$ directly, we will compute the fractional electron density
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M2:theory:X_e_definition}
    \X \equiv \frac{n_e}{n_H},
\end{equation}
where $n_H$ is the proton density. We will neglect Helium and heavier elements, i.e. assume that all baryons are protons, giving  
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M2:theory:helium_baryon_number_density}
    n_H=n_b \approx \frac{\rho_b}{m_H} = \frac{\obn \rhocn}{m_H a^3},
\end{equation}
where $\rhocn\equiv \frac{ H_0^2}{8\pi G}$ is the critical density of the universe today and $m_H$ is the hydrogen mass. We have assumed the small difference between the proton mass and Hydrogen mass to be negligible.

\note{"Derive" Saha?}

The Saha equation is given as 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:M2:theory:saha_equation}
    \frac{\X^2}{1-\X} = \frac{1}{n_b} \closed{\frac{m_e \tb}{2\pi}}^{3/2} e^{-\epsn / \tb},
\end{equation}
where $\tb$ is the temperature of the baryons, and $\epsn=13.6\unit{eV}$ is the Hydrogen ionization energy. The time evolution of the baryon temperature is governed by a differential equation coupled to $\X$. However, we will assume that $\tb$ follows the photon temperature, $T_\gamma$, evolving as 
\begin{equation}
    \tb = T_\gamma = \tcmb e^{-x}.
\end{equation}
\note{Cite stuff above, and reference to quantities.}

\begin{equation}
    \dv{\X}{x} = \frac{C_r(\tb)}{H}\bracket{\beta(\tb)(1-\X) - n_H \alpha^{(2)}(\tb) \X^2 }
\end{equation}


\begin{align}
    C_r(\tb) &= \frac{\Lambda_{2s\to1s} + \Lambda_\alpha}{\Lambda_{2s\to1s} + \Lambda_\alpha + \beta^{(2)}(\tb)}, \\
    \Lambda_{2s\to1s} &= 8.227\unit{s^{-1}}, \\
    \Lambda_\alpha &= H \frac{(3\epsn)^3}{(8\pi)^2 n_{1s}}\unit{s^{-1}}, \\
    n_{1s} &= (1-\X) n_H \unit{m^{-3}}, \\
    \beta^{(2)}(\tb) &= \beta(\tb) e^{3\epsn/4\tb} \unit{s^{-1}},\\
    \beta(\tb) &= \alpha^{(2)}(\tb) \closed{\frac{m_e \tb}{2\pi}}^3/2 e^{-\epsn/\tb} \unit{s^{-1}}, \\
    \alpha^{(2)} &= \frac{64\pi}{\sqrt{27\pi}} \frac{\alpha^2}{m_e^2} \sqrt{\frac{\epsn}{\tb}} \phi_2(\tb)\unit{m^2\,s^{-1}}, \\
    \phi_2(\tb) &= 0.448\ln(\epsn/\tb).
\end{align}
