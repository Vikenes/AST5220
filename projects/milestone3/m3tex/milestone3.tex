\section{Milestone III}\label{sec:M3}
So far we have only considered the flat FLRW metric for a homogeneous Universe, and used this to study the recombination history of the Universe. In this section we will consider small perturbations to the background, and thereby introduce inhomogeneities. We will consider perturbations to the FLRW metric and the matter contents of the Universe, where we limit ourselves to photons, baryons and CDM. We will restrict ourselves to linear perturbations only, which allows us to derive good approximations for the Boltzmann and Einstein equations. From this we are able to study the evolution of structure in the early Universe, which we later will connect to statistical observables in the Universe. This means that we ignore contributions from neutrinos and polarization. This means that we set $\neff=0$ when we compute relevant quantities from \secref{sec:M1} and \secref{sec:M2} that we will need in this section.
