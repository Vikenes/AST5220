\subsubsection{Metric perturbations}\label{ssec:M3:theory}
For the perturbed metric we use Newtonian gauge \pnote{Explain/cite}, and write it as  
\begin{equation}
    g_{\mu\nu} = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        -(1+2\Psi) & 0 \\
        0 & a^2 \delta_{ij}(1+2\Phi)
    \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where we have introduced the perturbations $\Psi$ and $\Phi$, which are functions of both position and time. For $\Psi=\Phi=0$ we derive the FLRW metric.
