\section{Milestone III}\label{M3}
Having successfully implemented the background cosmology, the next step in 
developing our model is to include interactions between particles. After the Big Bang, the early universe was highly ionized. Due to Thompson scattering, photons were strongly coupled to baryons. As the Universe expanded, and the temperature dropped, neutral atoms were able to form, and the photons were able to escape from the plasma. These are the CMB photons we observe today. The period where neutral atoms formed is called recombination, and will be the main topic of this section. Our goal is to compute the number density of free electrons in the Universe, and use this to estimate when recombination occurred. The evolution of free electrons will affect both structure formation and the resulting power spectrum of the CMB photons, as we will study later.
